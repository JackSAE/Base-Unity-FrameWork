# Base-Unity-Framework

The Base Unity FrameWork is a great way to save time as it has a good quantity of scripts and assets that are all set up to go. All the useful and common folders are already set up as well as a Credits and MainMenu Scene. 

## Platforms
This is only a Unity Framework. Can confirm scripts work on Windows.
